            <br>
            <span class="info">KCA University</span> , professional
            bug finder, and front-end code wrangler. I turn coffee â˜• and late
            nights ðŸŒ™ into beautiful, responsive
            websites.

            Currently on a mission to master HTML, CSS, JavaScript</a>, and make
          buttons that actually do stuff. When I'm
          not
          coding, I'm probably Googling how to fix what I just broke, or
          plotting my next tech idea. Letâ€™s make the web
          a
          cooler place together!
